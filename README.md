# Team5
ENVIRONMENT:
The project was built in, and ideally suited for Windows 10. However, the project will also run on MacOS. The project was developed in Visual Studios, and should you need to build the project it is very likely the same IDE will be needed. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS:
Simply unzip the folder, navigate to the Release folder (ChocAn -> ChocAn -> bin -> Release). There, you will find an executable file. Run the executable and enjoy!


INSTRUCTIONS FOR MacOS:
To run the program on MacOS, the project needs to be built from the solution file. Inside the root ChocAn folder, there is a ChocAn.sln file. Open this file in Visual Studios, and build the project from within Visual Studios, which should open the terminal prompt.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX:
Download and install your favorite Virtual Machine software, and create a Windows 10 virtual machine, then see instructions for running the program on Windows.
