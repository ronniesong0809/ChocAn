Simply unzip the folder, navigate to the Release folder (ChocAn -> ChocAn -> bin -> Release). There, you will find an executable file. Run the executable and enjoy!


### For MacOS
To run the program on MacOS, the project needs to be built from the solution file. Inside the root ChocAn folder, there is a ChocAn.sln file. Open this file in Visual Studios, and build the project from within Visual Studios, which should open the terminal prompt.
